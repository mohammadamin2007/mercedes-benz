The words ‘anticipate,’ ‘assume,’ ‘believe,’ ‘estimate,’ ‘expect,’ ‘intend,’ ‘may/might,’ ‘plan,’ ‘project,’ ‘should’ and similar expressions are used to indicate forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including an economic downturn in Europe or North America, changes in exchange rates, interest rates and raw materials prices, the launch of products by competitors, higher sales incentives, the successful implementation of the new business model for smart, and a decline in resale prices of used vehicles. If any of these risks and uncertainties (some of which are described in Mercedes-Benz Group AG’s most recent Annual Report under the heading ‘Risk Report’ and under the heading ‘Risk Factors’ in Form 20-F, which was submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) materialize or if the assumptions underlying any of our forward-looking statements prove incorrect, then our actual results may be materially different from those we express or imply by such statements. We do not intend or assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement applies only in relation to the situation prevailing on the date on which it is made.</p>
